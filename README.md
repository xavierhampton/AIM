**AIM** is a **fast, minimalistic, and lightweight aim trainer** built with **C** and **raylib**.  
It‚Äôs designed for **pure aim practice** without distractions, featuring classic map types like **Gridshot**, **Floatshot**, and **Tracking**, powered by a **custom map engine** that dynamically loads user created maps.  
Plus, it offers an **extremely customizable color scheme** for targets, crosshair, and HUD.

##  Custom Game Engine & Map Selector

AIM runs on a **custom-built engine** designed to load and manage multiple "maps" dynamically. Each map can define:

- Target count, size, and health  
- Target movement patterns (floating, tracking, or grid-based)  
- Map layout parameters (X/Y variation, gaps, min/max Z positions)  

Players can choose their preferred map with a **map selector UI**:

- Scroll through available maps  
- Preview map info: type, target size, count, speed, and layout  
- Instantly switch maps for a new training experience  

This system allows endless combinations of challenges and keeps your practice fresh.
